# Diary

Today was a crazy day at work, from 8 am to 8 pm.

I had so much to do, it was insane!


I've got a bunch of things on my plate.

Honestly, I'm not even sure if I can handle it all.

it's gotta get done.


During the last weekend, I visited San Diego.

Well, it wasn't as fun as I hoped.

The person I was with didn't really click with me.

And I was laying on the beach wearing short pants, my legs got super burnt.

I'm hurting like to death.

I took some medicine to ease the pain.


Anyway, the most important thing during a business trip is not to injure myself.

I really hope my legs recover soon.

foreach() is an Action, while map() is a Transformation.

foreach() returns None, while map() returns RDD.



The amp() call computed a new value for each row and it returned it so that I get a new RDD.

However, If i used foreach(), that would be useless because foreach() doesn't modify the rdd in any way.
This is a map() example.
```
>>> rdd = sc.parallelize(xrange(0, 10)).map(lambda x: x + 1)
>>> rdd.take(10)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```


And this is a foreach() example
```
>>> rdd = sc.parallelize(range(0, 10)).foreach(lambda x: x + 1)
>>> type(rdd)
<class 'NoneType'>
```


Conversely, calling map() on a function that returns None like print isn't very useful.


If you're using map() just for printing, it's not really useful.

map() is meant for transforming RDDs, while print() doesn't require any RDD transformation.

In such cases, it's better to use the foreach() function instead of map().
