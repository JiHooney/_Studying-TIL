# Diary
Today, I was trying to remove some datanodes from a cluster.

However, the decommissioning process is taking longer than I expected.

So, I'm just waiting patiently for it to finish.

In the meantime, I had some free time, so I decided to switch conda environment only staging cluster.

Luckily, I found a helpful guide, which I followed and successfully made the change.

Now, I'm planning to make the same change on all clusters.

Once the decommission job is completed, I'll need to test the spark code again.

Time is limited, but I'll do my best.
