# Diary
Today is a day off, so I decided to relax in my hotel room. 

I spent some time studying English by watching English YouTube videos and episodes of Friends. 

I'm not sure if my English skills are getting better or not, but I know I need to keep practicing. 

I don't have a specific plan on how to improve my English, but I'll just keep going and continue my efforts.

# TIL
Spark repartition and coalesce are a transform not action.

So If you want to use these method on RDD or DataFrame, DataSet, you have to make another variable like this.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# Create DataFrame
data = [("Alice", 25), ("Bob", 30), ("Charlie", 35), ("Dave", 40)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Age"])

# Change the number of partitions (repartition)
df_repartitioned = df.repartition(2)  # Repartition into 2 partitions

# Check the number of partitions
print(df_repartitioned.rdd.getNumPartitions())
```
