# Diary
Today is a holiday.
So I took a rest in my hotel room.
And I studied English.
I watched some English Youtube and Friends.
But I'm not sure whether my English skill is improving or not.
How should I improve my English.
I don't know.
I just have to keep going.

# TIL
Spark repartition and coalesce are a transform not action.
So If you want to use these method on RDD or DataFrame, DataSet, you have to make another variable like this.
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# Create DataFrame
data = [("Alice", 25), ("Bob", 30), ("Charlie", 35), ("Dave", 40)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Age"])

# Change the number of partitions (repartition)
df_repartitioned = df.repartition(2)  # Repartition into 2 partitions

# Check the number of partitions
print(df_repartitioned.rdd.getNumPartitions())
```
